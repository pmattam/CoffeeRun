CoffeeRun

Lunch coma is kicking in, help keep your colleagues awake by taking coffee orders!

Using the provided starting point, create a web application that can:

Take new orders with the coffee form
Display previously submitted orders
Add a new row to the list of orders every time you submit a new order
Only allow orders with a valid email address and coffee order to be submitted
Allow a user to mark an order as completed, then remove the order
Persist coffee orders in Local Storage so orders will be remembered when you refresh the page
You can either use jQuery, or the built-in DOM APIs.
